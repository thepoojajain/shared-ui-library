# ðŸ§± Shared UI Library

A reusable React component library built as part of a **Micro Frontend (MFE)** demo to showcase **build-time integration using npm and GitHub**.

This library is intended to be consumed by independently deployed apps that share a design system or core UI elements. It demonstrates how to share functionality across MFEs **without runtime orchestration**.
